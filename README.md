# Spartan-6-FPGA-T-Multiplexed-7-Segment-Display-for-8-Bit-MOD-10-Custom-Sequence.-
Designed and implemented an 8-bit MOD-10 custom sequence generator on Spartan-6 FPGA using Verilog, with two design methodologies: case construct and logic expressions derived from a state table. Integrated time-multiplexing to drive a 4-digit 7-segment display in hexadecimal format, reducing pin count and optimizing resource usage. Incorporated clock division for stable display refresh and validated functionality through FPGA hardware testing.
Tools/Languages: Verilog, Xilinx ISE, Spartan-6 FPGA
